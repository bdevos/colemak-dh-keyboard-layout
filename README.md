# Colemak DH keyboard layout for macOS

MacOS keylayout bundles for Colemak DH, this is cloned from [ColemakMods](https://github.com/ColemakMods/mod-dh) with
[the angle mod](https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/#angle-mod) to move the `z` key to the middle of the bottom row.
This was necessary because the original did not work for me on my ANSI keyboard.

## Install

To install, simply copy the `Colemak DH.bundle` file to your `Keyboard Layouts` directory: `Macintosh HD > Library > Keyboard Layouts`

After installation, you may need to log out of your system and log back
in for the keyboard layout to become available in your System
Preferences.

To enable the installed keyboard layout, launch the System Preferences
app and navigate to Keyboard -> Input Sources and use the + button in
the bottom left corner of the pane to select your desired keyboard
layout. The newly installed keyboard layouts should be available in the
"English" section.
