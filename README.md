# Colemak DH keyboard layout for macOS

MacOS keylayout bundle for Colemak DH, cloned from [ColemakMods](https://github.com/ColemakMods/mod-dh) with
[the Angle Mod](https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/#angle-mod) to move the `z` key to the middle of the bottom row.
This was necessary because the original layout did not work on my ANSI keyboard.
